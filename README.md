# Fake-SharePoint

This project was an attempt to imitate the look and feel of a proper sharepoint site

I plan to continue this project during the summer of 2022 so at the moment this is not a complete project.

At this point of the project, I am able to upload document into the server. 
Because of security issues, I have specified what type of documents can be uploaded into the server.
We are also able to register users into a csv database in the server. 

The main website is the welcome_get.php file that welcomes the user to upload or register their login information into a csv file.

Currently, my plan is to fix the fact that empty spaces keep saving into the database which 
will not be a good experience for the databse managers if this was a real company experience.

I have been busy with school currently and will make sure this project is complete by the end of August 2022 to be well precentable.

Thank you for viewing my Fake Sharepoint project
